# Daily Log — 2025-12-26

## What I touched
- Moved root docs into `docs/guides/` and `docs/design/`.
- Added docs index/runbook index/glossary/ADR stubs to align with workspace standards.
- Updated docs style references to `PROCESS.md` and linked new doc paths.
- Added extensive unit tests across AI/chat/CLI/runtime/store/domain to lift branch coverage.
- Added test-only prompt resource and updated `.gitignore` to ignore `.vawk/` + `target/`.
- Linked `docs/book/learn.awk.md` to the `docs/book/img/vawk.png` asset.
- Added a `bin/vawk` wrapper script and updated quickstart PATH guidance.
- Added wrapper PATH steps to the README quickstart list.
- Added a Learn AWK link at the top of the README.

## Notes / Risks
- No runtime changes; documentation and structure only.
- Tests now use reflection to exercise private branches in prompt loader and log repository.

## Tests / Evidence
- `mvn -q test`
- Not run (wrapper script + docs only).
- Not run (README update only).
- Not run (README link only).

## Next
- [ ] Review Adventure coverage gaps and plan targeted tests, 2025-12-26
