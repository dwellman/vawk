# Housekeeping (VAWK)

Last verified: 2026-01-04

The shared housekeeping playbook lives in the workspace shared-instructions folder
(see the workspace PROCESS.md or environment config for its location).

Local notes:
- Log cleanup sweeps in `docs/process/housekeeping/cleaning.log`.
- Use the pre-merge checklist at `docs/process/housekeeping/checklist.md`.
- Use `docs/process/housekeeping/deep-clean.md` + `docs/process/housekeeping/clean-log.md` for deep clean scope, protocol, and logging.
- Update `docs/process/bujo/daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` and `docs/process/journal.md` with scope, commands, risks, and follow-ups.
- Track JaCoCo coverage in `target/site/jacoco/index.html` when running tests; note shortfalls in BUJO and the journal.
