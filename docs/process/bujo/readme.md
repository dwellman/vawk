# Bullet Journaling for VAWK

This repo follows the BUJO pattern used by other Unna agents:
- `daily/` captures what changed each day, notable risks, and migrations.
- `weekly/` summarizes wins/risks and the next three priorities.
- `monthly/` tracks longer arcs or outcomes.
- `today-tomorrow-someday.md` tracks a rolling task list by horizon.

Keep bullets concise, migrate unfinished work forward, and prune stale lines. Log each working day in `daily/` and add a scope/tests note in `docs/process/journal.md`.
