# Daily Log — 2026-01-04

## What I touched
- Removed absolute path references from standards and housekeeping docs.
- Updated housekeeping docs to point to workspace-configured paths instead of hardcoded locations.

## Notes / Risks
- Docs-only change; no runtime behavior changes.

## Tests / Evidence
- Not run (docs-only change).

## Next
- [ ] Re-scan docs for any remaining absolute paths if new ones appear.
