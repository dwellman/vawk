# Daily Log — 2026-01-02

## What I touched
- Restructured docs to match Adventure standards (process logs, BUJO/journal, housekeeping templates).
- Moved guides/runbooks into `docs/howto/` and design/architecture/standards into `docs/reference/`.
- Refreshed docs index/readme and updated AGENTS + docs references for new paths.
- Archived legacy journal format and added a logs hub + housekeeping metadata.
- Repackaged the boot jar to run the CLI wrapper and verified `vawk test`.

## Notes / Risks
- Docs-only changes; no runtime or behavior changes.
- `vawk test` requires a `SPRING_AI_OPENAI_API_KEY` (dummy is enough) because Spring AI autoconfig instantiates the OpenAI model.

## Tests / Evidence
- `mvn -q test`
- `mvn -q package spring-boot:repackage`
- `SPRING_AI_OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy ./bin/vawk test`

## Next
- [ ] Review VAWK coverage gaps and plan targeted tests (tracked in Today list).
