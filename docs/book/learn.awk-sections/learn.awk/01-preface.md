## Preface

AWK is a small, focused language for scanning, filtering, and transforming text. It is old, simple, and unusually good at what it does. If you live in logs, CSV files, or line‑oriented text, AWK is a sharp tool that fits in your mental pocket.

This mini‑book has two goals:

1. Teach you how to read and write AWK by hand.
2. Prepare you to use tools like **VAWK** (an AWK “vibe coder”) without feeling dependent on them.

You should be able to:

- Look at an AWK script and understand what it is doing.
- Draft simple scripts on your own.
- Use an AI assistant as a collaborator, not as a mysterious black box.

The examples assume a Unix‑like shell, POSIX `awk`, and basic command‑line comfort.
