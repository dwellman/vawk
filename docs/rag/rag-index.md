# VAWK RAG Index

Use this hierarchy to keep context small and targeted. Each child index lists concrete files you can fetch for retrieval.

- `book/learn.awk-index.md` — Table of contents for the learn.awk book (17 files under `book/learn.awk/`).
- `examples/awk-snippets-index.md` — AWK snippet catalog (50 files under `examples/snippets/`).

Tip: load only the specific chapter/snippet files referenced by these indexes instead of bulk-loading everything. This keeps prompts token‑efficient.
